An innovative rhythm education tool! Drag and drop rhythms into the measure box to hear them counted out to a metronome! On mobile, you can also feel them vibrated out, and you can compose in up to four measures at a time, with multiple measure sizes available. The site can also be screenreader-optimized, and allows users to click rather than drag-and-drop rhythms.
